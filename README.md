# Google Play Store App Rating Prediction

A data-driven project to predict the ratings of apps on the Google Play Store based on various features like category, number of installs, reviews, and more. Built using regression-based machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze Play Store dataset and clean inconsistencies
- Perform EDA to identify key factors affecting ratings
- Build models to predict app ratings

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- XGBoost for improved prediction
- Google Colab

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/` - Analysis and model building
- `data/` - Original and cleaned datasets
- `outputs/` - Model performance metrics and visualizations

## ✅ Results
XGBoost and tuned Random Forest achieved the best performance (R² ≈ 0.18). Features like reviews, installs, and app size significantly impact ratings.

## 💡 Learnings
- Applied real-world ML regression techniques
- Understood feature importance and overfitting
